# Javadoc Search Frame

Javadoc incremental search for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

When viewing Javadocs, this script replaces the package and class frames with a single search frame that allows searching incrementally through all packages and classes at once.

This is achieved with client-side Javascript, so it will work on any local or remote Javadoc page.
